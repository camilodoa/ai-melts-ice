# ai.melts.ice's frontend

data is beautiful. this submodule uses intuitive graphs to display the
predictions generated by the neural-net.

this site was made with react, relying a fair amount on:

1. react-bootstrap
2. react-vis
3. mapbox
4. react-datepicker

## getting started

`npm install` to download all the necessary node_modules

`npm start` runs the app in development mode

omitted to this repo is a file (`front/src/tokens.js`) that you need to create yourself in order to get started.
to do so quickly, just fill out sampleTokens.js with your mapbox API token
and rename it tokens.js

## to do

- change searches and make a search bar (more google-y)

- change the graphing library and use a bar chart
